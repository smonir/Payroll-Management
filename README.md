*****Employee Payroll Management System****
Description:
This is a project build for educational purpose. As my varsity wants a project I have made it done. 
This project is about the payment management of a company. In a company one of the employee is assume as an admin and management the payment about employee will get the access of the software and can add information about the others employee of that company. 
They can upgrade salary or deduct salary of the employee with the permission of the CEO or the other admin who is in that positon. He also can generate the payment slip which will use at the cash section. After all verification an employee can get his payment. 
That’s my software. 

Table of contents:
Here is some contents in the software:
1.	Add Employee
2.	Search
3.	Upgrade Salary
4.	Deduction
5.	Pay slip
6.	 Log out
The print section of the slip is not created here. It will save as a PDF file in the chosen directory, after that it can be printed. 

Installation: 
 As this is not an EXE file so that the installation is not the same here. Here you need a platform of java development called “NetBeans”. Just download this full project and extract that in a directory.
